# .dotfiles

Are you an Isaiah from the future who forgot how to use his blazingly-fast system config?

Are you someone else who wants the blazing speed you see from Isaiah's developemt?

Look no further, for here is the summary of how to use the system created by Isaiah's dotfiles.

## Quickstart
To copy the config, clone this repo to your home folder. You should have the following folder: '~/.dotfiles'.

To load the config, cd into '.dotfiles' and use the command 'stow ' plus the name of the folder you want to config of on your system. For example, if I want to load the vim config onto my system, I would type 'stow vim' and press enter. This command creates symlinks for all the files in the vim folder in the current parent directory, which is the home directory in this case.

Assuming you have stowed the appropriate files for an aplication, all you shoul dneed is a restart of the application for the config files to take effect.

## Keybinds/Configs for Each Program
